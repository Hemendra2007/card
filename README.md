# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the `pygame` library. The game includes several enhanced features, such as level progression, dynamic obstacle generation, and customizable gameplay elements.

## Features

- **Start Screen**: The game begins with a welcome screen where the player can press any key to start.
- **Dynamic Food and Obstacle Colors**: The color of the food and obstacles changes randomly, providing a visually engaging experience.
- **Level Progression**: The game becomes progressively more challenging as the player advances through levels. The snake's speed increases with each level, and new obstacles are added.
- **Boundary Wrapping**: The snake can move across the screen edges, wrapping around to the opposite side instead of triggering a game over.
- **Pause Functionality**: Players can pause and resume the game by pressing the `P` key.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- **P Key**: Pause and resume the game.
- **Any Key**: Start the game from the start screen.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Guide the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid colliding with itself or the obstacles.
2. **Food**: The food will appear randomly on the screen. Eating food increases your score and causes the snake to grow longer.
3. **Obstacles**: Avoid hitting the obstacles that appear on the screen. Hitting an obstacle or the snake's own body will end the game.
4. **Levels**: The game becomes more difficult as you score more points, with the speed of the snake increasing and more obstacles appearing.
